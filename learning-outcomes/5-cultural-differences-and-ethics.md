### Learning outcome

> You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

## Clarifications

_Recognize:_ Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

_Take into account:_ Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures;

- Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.

## Implementation

For the group project an ethics and cultural analysis was created for the 'TeamFinder' application with the ultimate goal of seeing if there was room for improvement. There certainly was, although the document was only produced towards the end of the project's lifespan. This resulted in the found improvements not being utilized to their potential, the projected points of interests were purely theoretical. The best way to implement this would've been to make this analysis at the beginning of the project, this way we could've used the results to steer the direction of the GP to better suit ethical and cultural standards/biases.

Within the group project there was not a high demand to adept communication as the standards were quite well-defined and standardized. Communication went per Teams and/or email if deemed necessary. Contact moments were planning using the built in calender and meeting functionality of Teams. Although this semester was one of the first semesters where working according to AGILE principles was valued and prioritized over technical aspects. In this area we had a lot to learn and there were certainly areas in which there was room for improvement. Suggestions during and at the end of the project were taking to heart and implemented to improve the working culture within the project and also between project and stakeholders.

In the individual project an analysis was not made, however the code of conduct regarding ethics became much more apparent as the application grew in size, maturity and functionality. The need to be able to delete all records was growing as the historical data kept steadily growing in size. From [ACM's code of ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), point 1.2 and 1.6 are most prevalent.

### 1.2 Avoid harm

Avoid harm is most visible in the scoping of resources which the 'SpottedCharts' application, by choosing NOT to access more information than we REALLY require, we actively participate in the minimastation of potential data leaks. The harm that can be done by leaking listening history would probably be minimal, alas we still choose not to save more data and we offer solutions for removing historic data.

### 1.6 Respect privacy

The topic of privacy is especially important when relating to information based on a user. To ensure the safety of our users' data we choose to only save what is absolutely necessary for the functionalities of the app, users can see prior to accepting WHICH data is going to be shared with our application, there is a possibility of removing historic data etc.

## Relevant questions

### Why is it important to analyse cultural differences and ethical aspects with regard to software engineering?

By analysis cultural differences within a group/team you can evaluate potential risks and struggles associated with a team. This can be in regard to expectations, working hours etc. But this can also relate to deeply rooted core values and ways to communicate. A clear example of this is implied vs direct communication.

> Direct communication is when the speaker communicates true intentions directly in the verbal message.
>
> Direct communicators’ messages usually don’t have an underlying meaning. They value direct answers, honesty and frankness. This communication style is considered more “task-oriented” because criticism is expressed more freely and it is taken less personally.
>
> Direct people are not afraid of conflict and are used to disagree with others openly. For them, honesty is the best policy.

>
> Indirect communication is when true intentions are not verbally expressed but come from context or non-verbal communication. Indirect speakers usually don’t make a direct statement if it may cause tension or conflict. They will find more convoluted ways to reply to avoid saying “no”.
>
> For them being polite and “saving face” – avoid hurting another person’s self-esteem is more important than giving an honest answer.
>
> Since direct conflict must be avoided at any cost, indirect speakers will express disapproval or unease by non-verbal communication, vague questions or even complaining to a third party.

### What is ACM and how does it influence software development?

ACM is the 'Association for Computing Machinery', they are an organization responsible for bridging the gaps between researchers, ethics, computing educators and more.[^2] What this means is ACM is able to produce high-quality verified works, studies, advices and codes of conduct. Said created works are then distributed through their large network of professionals in the field, one of these larger products is the 'ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conducts'.

These guidelines encompass the basic concepts which a 'computing professional' should be familiar with and strive to implement in their daily work and/or life. It describes a set of standards which should result in a working environment which is not only pleasant to be involved in, but also is able of providing a societal growth by technical means. A list of the basic concepts provided by the 'ACM Code 2018 Task Force':[^3]

> 1. GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
>
> - 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
> - 1.2 Avoid harm.
> - 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.
> - 1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
> - 1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
> - 1.6 Respect privacy.
> - 1.7 Honor confidentiality.
>
> 2.  PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
>
> - 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
> - 2.2 Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.
> - 2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
> - 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
> - 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
> - 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.
> - 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
> - 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
>
> 3.  PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES
>
> - 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
> - 3.2 Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
> - 3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
> - 3.4 Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.
> - 3.5 Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.
> - 3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
> - 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.
>
> 4.  COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
>
> - 4.1 Uphold, promote, and respect the principles of the Code.
> - 4.2 Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM.
