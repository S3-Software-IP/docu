## Description

### Learning outcome

> You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

### Clarification

_Professional manner:_

- You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed software methodology and following team agreements.
- You are able to track your work progress and communicate your progress with the team.
- You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
- You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

## Implementation

We started this semester thinking we were already very professional, but soon found out this wasn't really the case. We were pretty organized inside our project group from the start. So we made some agreements and setup some tooling like a groups app for more practical stuff and discord for content-related stuff. and this worked great for the first couple of weeks until we kind of forgot invite our teachers to the teams appointment. So that wasn't very professional. And it that sprint we messed up our sprint board so our stakeholders had to wait during the sprint presentation witch wasn't very professional either.

After the sprint we had [sprint-review](../learning-outcomes/3-agile-method.md#sprint-reviews-and-refinement-sessions) were we all agreed something needed to change. So we set our focus on changing our professional skills by paying more attention to these points:

- More and clearer communication to our stakeholders and teacher
- Consistently letting letting your group mates know what your doing. In the standups and outside it.
- Asking for help if your getting stuck at your current ticket.
- Be on time! And letting know when your later.
- Doing more [refinement-sessions](../learning-outcomes/3-agile-method.md#sprint-reviews-and-refinement-sessions) and sprint reviews

these where the most important. And after that sprint review we saw a lot of improvement in our group. The communication inside and to the teachers/stakeholders was miles better. Everyone came on time and knew what the had to do and knew what others were doing.

In the next sprint, we received complements from our teacher Thijs, acknowledging a improvement in our professional skills, seeing the quality of our delivered work. This positive spirit continued throughout the next sprints. This moment for our growth occurred during a challenging sprint where we faced difficulties. However, from that experience we learned a lot, implemented corrective measures, and as a result, our performance drastically improved. We maintained this upward momentum, showing our teachers and stakeholders that we sustained progress and enhanced capabilities.

### Escalating and Problem-Solving in a Challenging Situation

During a project involving front-end Spotify authentication, I encountered a significant technical challenge. We weren't receiving the crucial access-token and refresh token from the Spotify Web API, hindering our project's progress. I embarked on a day-long journey to resolve this issue, consulting my team and seeking guidance from my teacher.

Recognizing the need for effective problem-solving and escalation, I decided to take a bold step. I committed to rewriting the code from scratch, using the official documentation as my guide. I set a one-hour deadline, and if that didn't work, I would seek further assistance from my teacher.

This experience taught me the vital skill of escalation in a professional context. It highlighted the importance of knowing when to ask for help, collaborate, and make decisive actions. Ultimately, I successfully resolved the issue by starting over, demonstrating my commitment to professionalism in software development.
