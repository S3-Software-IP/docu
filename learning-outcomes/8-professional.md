## Implementation

We started this semester thinking we were already very professional, but soon found out this wasn't really the case. We were pretty organized inside our project group from the start. So we made some agreements and setup some tooling like a groupsapp for more practical stuff and discord for content-related stuff. and this worked great for the first couple of weeks until we kind of forgot invite our teachers to the teams appointment. So that wasn't very professional

### Escalating and Problem-Solving in a Challenging Situation

During a project involving front-end Spotify authentication, I encountered a significant technical challenge. We weren't receiving the crucial access-token and refresh token from the Spotify Web API, hindering our project's progress. I embarked on a day-long journey to resolve this issue, consulting my team and seeking guidance from my teacher.

Recognizing the need for effective problem-solving and escalation, I decided to take a bold step. I committed to rewriting the code from scratch, using the official documentation as my guide. I set a one-hour deadline, and if that didn't work, I would seek further assistance from my teacher.

This experience taught me the vital skill of escalation in a professional context. It highlighted the importance of knowing when to ask for help, collaborate, and make decisive actions. Ultimately, I successfully resolved the issue by starting over, demonstrating my commitment to professionalism in software development.
