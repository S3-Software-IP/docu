## Introduction

This document serves as the guide through semester 3 demand-based software. Here we shall connect all our documentation to our learning outcomes. The goal here is to demonstrate the skills necessary to pass this semester.

## Learning outcomes

- [1. Web Application](./learning-outcomes/web-application.md)
- [2. Software Quality](./learning-outcomes/software-quality.md)
- [3. Agile Method](./learning-outcomes/agile-method.md)
- [4. CI/CD](./learning-outcomes/ci-cd.md)
- [5. Cultural differences & ethics](./learning-outcomes/cultural-differences-and-ethics.md)
- [6. Requirements & design](./learning-outcomes/requirements-and-design.md)
- [7. Business processes](./learning-outcomes/business-processes.md)
- [8. Professional](./learning-outcomes/professional.md)

## Learning outcome rating table

| Learning outcome      | Proficiency rating | Elaboration                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Web application       | Orienting          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Software quality      | Undefined          | As we, at the moment, do not have any unit, system, regression or other tests to ensure the safety and performance of our application(s), we have marked this learning outcome as undefined for the time being.   |
| Agile method          | Orienting          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| CI/CD                 | Undefined          | We do not have any plans nor working products using the CI/CD methodology. Think Github actions, docker etc. these are items we want to work on but have yet to get to.                                           |
| Cultural differences  | Orienting          | Within our project, we have looked into the differences from one another regarding data privacy and ethical conduct within ICT. We have discussed our differences and come to a consensus within our application. |
| Requirements & Design | Undefined          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
