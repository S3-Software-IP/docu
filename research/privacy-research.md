## Privacy in our projects

### Group project

In our group project, we handled a significant amount of personal information pertaining to the employees of IO. Privacy considerations were paramount throughout our project, given that we had access to the Cisco router data, allowing us to monitor the presence and locations of individuals within the building. Additionally, we were granted permission to access the personal agendas of their employees, further amplifying the sensitivity of the information at hand.

As stewards of this confidential data, we implemented stringent measures to safeguard privacy and adhere to ethical standards. Our commitment to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the information entrusted to us was central to our project methodology. We recognize the gravity of handling such sensitive details and approached our responsibilities with the utmost diligence and professionalism.

### Duo project

During our duo project we came to the conclusion that when didn't really needed to save data. But 1 of our learning outcomes required us to use an ORM so we didn't really had a choose. That why we still tried to save as less that as we could to make the application more secure. This is why the only sensitive data that we store in our database is: The name, email, authorization and refresh token and all the "top items" of the user. The handling of user accounts is all done by Spotify.
