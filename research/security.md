## Introduction

In the vast world of the internet, security is something almost everyone faces.
Especially for folks like software engineers, architects, and project leads,
it's a common challenge. Security issues can be as simple as dealing with things
like [SQL injection](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp) or using
a regular insecure
[http](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/) page.

This document is all about looking into how to make things more secure and protect
user data for those who use or are involved with the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).

To answer this question we shall take a deeper look into basic security measures,
how to implement these and what value they can add.
In the end we decided on an implementation for our specific use-case using
the results from our research. Together with this implementation we made a
'proof of concept' (Poc) to go along with the conclusion.

## What do user accounts encompass?

## What are some of the security concerns regarding accounts?

## What kind of security does the Spotify WebAPI implement?

## Proof of concept (PoC)
